  1. Team Profile
</div>
   -	Team Name
“The Spartans” is my team’s name, the name came from a movie with the same name. I choose this because they have a powerful spartan army, and I want our group to be as healthy, strong and connected as the warriors.
Finally, this is our team:
#Nguyễn Thế Minh
#Nguyễn Phương Nam
#Võ Khải Minh	
#Võ Trần Khánh Linh
#Bùi Nguyễn Ngọc Tuấn
   -Team Profile
On the last assignment, my grading was only on the CR section, which isn’t a high grade, and this will affect who I want to be my teammate. In my opinion, I want teammates who can lead, work together well and had experience in operating a project so I can learn from them. The most important thing is still the chemistry between each individual. With a good connection, we can overcome the lack of experience and make the project successful. I hope after this, apart from the project, I can make great friends.

  3. Project Ideas
</div>
   -	Overview
When it comes to project ideas, I want to build a biometric based ATM system, at lease in this course. Fingerprint scanning is one of the types of biometrics system, it is currently being used on many devices for authentication purposes, especially on smartphones, and now I want to bring this idea applied on ATMs. Because each person has a unique fingerprint, it is safer and safer to use fingerprint as a means of authentication to access the ATM than to use an ATM card. Users do not have to always bring their ATM cards with them, so they can use their fingerprints to access ATM services.
   -	Motivation
Every year, millions suffered from different types of card scamming, card skimming technique is the most well-known kind of scam, and it’s becoming more and more popular. Crooks use a small gadget called a skimmer to steal credit card details whenever an ATM card swipe through. To record your PIN, criminals can also position a little, undetectable camera nearby. This gives the thief all the data needed to make fake cards and steal cash from the checking account of the cardholder. So, with this idea, we can prevent this from happening with a higher security system
   -	Description
The use of fingerprint for security is progressively utilized in different fields like criminology and security reason. My intention for this idea is to make ATMs and its service more secure and improve user experience. When implying this idea to reality, traditional ATM cards can be replaced with fingerprints, so we don't have to carry our credit or debit cards anymore. To make this possible, we need to have a connection with banks and their approval to add our idea to their system; the reason for this has several purposes, such as: in some cases, user want to deposit money from other bank ATMs, that's mean that bank can authorize every account. Before account owners can use the fingerprint-based ATM, bankers had had their customers' fingerprint and number phone data to store it in the bank database. Besides use fingerprint, customers could use other types to be verified, such as faces, eyes or their whole hand. When creating an account, they are free to decide what they want for their bank account security. 
The client gets three opportunities to get his identity confirmed. If the fingerprints don't coordinate, fingerprint service will stop, and further verification will be required. There are different ways for them to verify themselves; the user can log in to their banking app and turn the service back on; if the client doesn't have the app, they had to go to their bank and ask them to turn it on. After inserting the user fingerprint, a six-digit number will be randomly generated and sent to the user's phone. The code must be correct when the customer puts it in, or else; they can't access it further. 
The client can also choose to turn on alerts when there are strange activities that involve their bank accounts. I want to develop a system when someone tries to gain access to an account, but the account owner's phone is over 200m from the ATM, there will an alert send to the phone, and the client can lock the account down to prevent their being transfer away. 
Our system still can detect damaged fingerprint that some of the design on the market does not have, so even if you have a cut on your fingertip, the ATMs know that's you not only that the system could detect even with wet hands.  
In conclusion, ATM increment the bank association's dependability by giving the simple admittance to the money exchange. We can pull out the money anyplace and whenever without holding up in line. Consequently, ATM card is utilized uncontrollably; however, we must face the misrepresentation identified with the ATM exchange. To make ATM exchange safer, we are using a biometric scanning machine to distinguish the record holder. And to go with biometric scanning, we add some more features to the system to improve the user experience.  
   -	Tools and Technologies
During this project, I will be using MySQL and python to develop the project. I think these two languages are the perfect coding platform for this particular project. And with its libraries, the languages make it so much easier to work. The equipment that I will be using is a window-laptop, a fingerprint module or a face recognition module (if necessary). The fingerprint module can be bought on the internet. We might have to modify the equipment to fit into our project because most of the products cant detect water or an injury on the finger and add some alert feature when someone tried to log in using the wrong fingerprint.
This is the link to buy a fingerprint module: https://nshopvn.com/product/cam-bien-nhan-dang-van-tay/?gclid=CjwKCAiA_eb-BRB2EiwAGBnXXsKm4r2H8yf_GEYWbdCeqHJJ-9sWb3mj5hHMl6secNGQlj5n8blMExoCx1gQAvD_BwE 
   -	Skills Required
To make a fully functional system, you must know basic programming in MySQL and Python. I think these two languages are perfect for the project. Communication and teamwork are essential since you will not do this project alone. Besides, researching skill is necessary; you have to know to dig useful information such as a video showing how the project should run and fix common problems. Problems solving may become an essential element since this project's main idea is to reduce ATM cards' trouble.
   -	Outcome
If the project is successful, lots and lots of people will not have to deal with losing money. The damage from ATM fraud will be reduced significantly. You won’t worry about losing your PIN because they generate randomly every time you use an ATM. Not only that, but the user also will receive a better customer experience.

  4. Feedback
</div>
   -	Nguyễn Thế Minh 
This is indeed a good idea; however, that would make the dataset much more complicated since we will be taking the fingerprint of many different customers. Furthermore, it would take much longer since we are talking about going through many fingerprints simultaneously. Even iPhone takes time to scan your fingerprint even though you only save your fingerprints. Now, we are comparing hundreds of thousands of different fingerprints, which might cause an inconvenience to the customer. Moreover, you had an idea of what you should do. However, the project is much more complicated since it realizes which fingerprint it belongs to regardless of that fingerprint condition. It requires machine learning, which might be complicated. Nevertheless, it is a good idea and has a bright future ahead.  

   -	Bùi Nguyễn Ngọc Tuấn:
This would be a great idea because it is more convenient not bringing anything than carrying a credit card with you all the time. I could see this working as some public places, such as schools or gyms, replace cards with fingerprints. Even so, I think that for university students like us, this idea can't work in a short period, as it is considered a large-scale project. Moreover, changing the ATM system might cause unexpected errors, such as the transition of the database between the cards and fingerprints. It would be a better idea if we had more time for the project.

   -	Võ Trần Khánh Linh:
Your idea is very useful, not only for the bank or the customers to secure their information but it can also be used in the schools or working places (I prefer the school usage since it takes so much time just for us to show our ID card to the security ) It can help us saved much time on taking attendance, making appointment, etc. But it will be quite complicated because the fingerprints also require having the sensor to detect a person’s identity. That means we not only focus on Python and MySQL but also how to build the hardware that can detect the fingerprints (it will act as an input for the conditions in Python). Also, the MySQL itself takes tons of time from us to build a complete database system. Based on the deadline, I don’t think it will be possible for us to construct something like that.

   -	Nguyễn Phương Nam:
Perfect. I wonder how two of them can combine together but very nice, good job.  In my case, I did a personal bank card but it only can be withdrawn money on Techcomback ATM. Even though, my password have been forgotten so I have to use my mobile phone app to get the money and it takes forever to get the money. Hopefully, the fingerprint will reduce the amount of time I have to spend in the ATM. Despite of the fact that we have to provide more personal information to protect our account, it will be more convienence from the customer’s perspective because the card or password can be forgotten but you will always bring your hand to the ATM.

  5. IT Tech
</div>
this project I put in two areas, that are cloud computing and privacy. We will discuss these two areas in this section.
   -	 Cloud computing
Cloud computing had been facilitating and conveying administrations on the Internet over the past several years. Today, like never before, organizations need to work and contend at a phenomenal speed and scale as ventures are reshaping underneath them. It implies developing quicker, making new income streams, getting more bits of knowledge from information and the edge and associating distinctively with their clients, accomplices and representatives. These progressions are essential, interconnected and require an impetus to drive them, and that is Cloud. For now, cloud computing boasts significant capabilities, primarily known by businesses and the IT industry for cost decrease, more noteworthy adaptability, flexibility and ideal asset usage. There is no denying that it takes a massive role in the world when talking about cloud computing's benefits and its strength. Firstly, cloud storage is one of the first things you mention when talking about this subject; it allows us to put away records, storing and recovering them from any web-empowered interface; accessing to this service is quite simple and convenient. Because it provides a high-speed connection to the storage with high security, not only the customers are benefited but also the company behind because they only pay for the consumer cloud storage and not the maintenance fee for the technology. Secondly, data backup is always a time- consuming problem where we have sometimes manually to recover the data. Still, with Cloud, we can choose to store all the files to Cloud automatically and can backup with few simple clicks, now you can recover your files no matter where you are. Thirdly, Hybrid Cloud is a processing climate that interfaces an organization's private cloud administrations and outsider public Cloud into a single. This kind of blend of public and private Cloud assets furnishes advantage of choosing ideal Cloud for every application. Specialized and business destinations are satisfied more successfully and cost-proficiently than could be with public and private Cloud are separated. Same with, multi-Cloud take a little bit further when it allows you to use two or more different Cloud companies; options for users to choose what base is the best for their needs is available. 
We can't predict the future, but we can calculate the chances of Cloud computing, and it seems bright. One of the problems we have to deal with nowadays data storage, and its growing with an unthinkable rate; the only solution is Cloud, companies starting to realize and investing in Cloud provide. In the future, with the assistance of the IoT and Cloud Computing, we can store information in the Cloud, for a better internet connection. On marketsandmarkets.com, the report said that "The global cloud computing market size is expected to grow from USD 371.4 billion in 2020 to USD 832.1 billion by 2025"(https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html). We can see the fact that later on, applications will store in spots other than the Cloud. This application will keep on various modules, on workers of different Cloud Service.
There's the desire that Cloud Computing offers extraordinary opportunities for clients because it decreases the overall fetched of proprietorship of data frameworks and subsequently brought down the obstruction to procurement individually utilization of IT frameworks for undertakings. Cloud Computing to pose several challenges for ventures as well as for private citizens. There can be expanding virtualization of the preparing of individual and other touchy information that's transmitted and put away by commercial suppliers on servers arranged in an area obscure to the costumer. So, information security and security are pivotal issues, since it has continuously been a constraining figure for the belief that businesses and consumers have in cloud administrations. Frequently it isn't clear which of the different arguments are substances and which are myths. It moreover uncovers that there's no clear understanding of who can take the data and how to prevent that from happening. 
Cloud had huge impacts on a student’s college life like myself. It provides permission to access data at any time, anywhere; for less fortunate students, such as some in less developed countries, they can reach to education and communities via the internet. Making friends or shopping online had never been easier since social networks are created thanks to cloud computing. Cloud computing innovation is also picking up pace within the healthcare industry. Many can have their medical records, shows that cloud had an impact on all lives.
   -	Cybersecurity 
Personal information leaking is unpreventable when using internet website and social networks, as scary as it sounds, cybersecurity had protections to keep our data save. Cybersecurity became one of the most to discuss the subject when it comes to information privacy. Firstly, the new type of firewalls is going to take to a whole new level. The next-generation firewall ensures websites, and web apps from infection and malware contaminations whereas anticipating interruption from programmers and blocking dispersed refusal of benefit (DDoS) assaults Advertising high-performance danger assurance, it is planned to keep mission-critical applications secure. Another new digital safeguard arrangement is co-operative cyber-security, this work when different partners share other files at the same place; it implies that for a hacker to take information from any of the members, all of the devices would require to be hacked. To hack into the system, hackers need to unencrypted every single data that had been split into thousand of numbers and store randomly in each party machines and the percentage of success is almost 0%. “Moving target security” is the name that was given to another method of cybersecurity by an Israeli company, the technique is considered simple to understand and to do but difficult to break the system. This technique for security randomly relocated location and file’s name in the sever, as well as the application. The last method I want to mention is called air gapping; it is an isolated system where the local network and the internet are separated. The benefit is undeniably incredible when a piece of sensitive information is needed to be protected, and this technique is most known by the government and use for military and nuclear purposes. However, the system can still be hacked when the devices were made; for example, in 2018, Chinese agents were accused of putting spy chip on machines and phones that were factory by many US companies, it creates political problems.(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies) 
At the moment, cybercrime is growing at an alarming rate; million was affected over the past year, since almost every business had its own type of transaction and data storing, Cybersecurity is needed more than ever, perhaps in the future too. Information advancement and Cybersecurity are immovably connected; this suggests that future organization security is solidly joined to the progress of the web and future information development. In this age, all the vital structures are interconnected and driven by PCs, and this predicts the future where the affiliation will be a lot tighter. The future network safety frameworks should have the option to deal with a lot of information, manage a bigger populace and take choices continuously.
I am thankful for cybersecurity and its help to the people. I, myself was born in the golden age of the internet, everything was new, and both data stealing and network protection were still at its beginning. Without cybersecurity, my naive in the young age would bring troubles to my home since people can access to my data and use it for harmful ideas.

After spending some time watching youtube videos about interview IT professional, I had concluded a result what I want to be working with in the future.
Title: Macbook Pro chat with Apple's Craig Federighi!
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWoqwCGQIM0&list=PLBsP89CPrMePNK7yIxcyRdiIFentQVHra&index=7&t=271s)
According to Wikipedia, Craig Federighi After graduating from Acalanes High School in Lafayette, California, Federighi earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and later a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. Federighi returned to Apple in 2009, hired to lead macOS engineering at a time when Apple had just finished developing Mac OS X Snow Leopard, which was highly regarded for its focus on quality.[8] In March 2011, Federighi succeeded Bertrand Serlet as vice president of Mac Software Engineering at Apple, and in August 2012 he was promoted to senior vice president, reporting to CEO Tim Cook. Upon Scott Forstall's departure from Apple, his role was expanded to encompass iOS in addition to macOS. As of September 2016, Federighi was reported to own more than 500,000 shares of Apple stock worth about US$180 million as of June 2020. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi)
•	Tools to getting into web developer: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HYkN84PGfk)
Since I was a kid, my ideal jobs had always been a web developers. Web developing is a testing profession focused on inventive critical thinking and ceaseless development. As a web engineer you'll work with a multidisciplinary group of architects, different designers, and advertisers to understand your tasks.
To be a web developer isn't easy, used to these coding language such as HTML-CSS-javascript is only the first step. HTML is the most utilized markup language across the web, and web engineers use it to make pages on the Internet. CSS, then again, is utilized to style the site. It's answerable for the selection of text styles, shadings and format in a web structure. However, HTML establishes the framework for a page, CSS styles it. JavaScript is a significant-level programming language that executes complex highlights onto a site. This includes things like moving components, search bars, recordings or intuitive guides on a website page. In knowing JavaScript, you'll have the option to meet better standards from your customers in the web improvement measure. Utilizing these abilities, you'll have the opportunity to pull in more page watchers, also, since most individuals will participate in general lean toward intuitive site pages that catch their eye. Uncommon highlights go far in drawing in watchers, and your occupation as a web designer assumes a huge function in observing them work out as expected on an advanced screen. The most important part is still our passion for the job. My path to the web development is to create new, significant services and fixing trouble that I am experiencing right now.
